# Project Information

This repository contains a number of scripts that I have written or re-configured to enhance it's performance or to fit my needs. All the scripts are meant to make a day-to-day life easier for a Microsoft 365 Administrator and a System Administrator. These are provided for free under the MIT License.

# Using the scripts

To use the scripts it is recommended to download the repository since each script must be ran on you local machine/server. 
For the scripts to work, ensure that you equipment allows the execution of Scripts with the following command:
<code> set-executionpolicy Unrestricted </code>

All the scripts are designed to be ran as a stand alone script, this means that every script will include all the necessary dependencies and/or modules, including validation if the modules is installed and if not it will request the installation. The installation of the modules can be preformed directly from each script, if the option is rejected it will provide the necessary commands to install the module.

# Leaning how to use PowerShell 

If you are interested in leaning how to develop PowerShell scripts, I would recommend taking a look at [Automate administrative tasks by using PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/powershell/) since it's the learning path created by Microsoft. 
You can also check the PowerShell tutorial from [Tutorial Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powershell/index.htm)
