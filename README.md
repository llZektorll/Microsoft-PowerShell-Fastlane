# Project Information

This repository contains a number of scripts that I have written or re-configured to enhance its performance or to fit my needs. All the scripts are meant to make a day-to-day life easier for a Microsoft 365 Administrator and a System Administrator. These are provided for free under the MIT License.

##  Project update

2022-05-22 -> This project have suffered a major update. All the files have been moved around to fit the new organization of the project.

# Using the scripts

To use the scripts it is recommended to download the repository since each script must be ran on you local machine/server. 
For the scripts to work, ensure that your equipment allows the execution of Scripts with the following command:
<code> set-executionpolicy Unrestricted </code>


All the scripts are importing a configuration file. This file will contain the function, variables and module verifications required on any of the scripts. 
This configuration files is set-up to identify the folder where it is saved/ran and use as the root path to all the logs and export paths.

# Leaning how to use PowerShell 

If you are interested in leaning how to develop PowerShell scripts, I would recommend taking a look at [Automate administrative tasks by using PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/powershell/) since it's the learning path created by Microsoft. 
You can also check the PowerShell tutorial from [Tutorial Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powershell/index.htm)
