# CONTRIBUTING

Hi! First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing this project. 

This is a big experiment on trying to create a repository that contains as many scripts as possible to make day-to-day life easier to system administrators.

## Setup & Consistency

To contribute, please download the lates version of this repository. This is important to avoid duplicated content.

To ensure that there is a standard you will find a folder named 0-Template. In this folder there will be a set of templates to ensure all scripts are ran the same way. This will include, how the script is commented to the connection functions used in the case of Azure and Office 365.

All the scripts must be placed inside the folder corresponding to it's technology so it can be easier to search for the information.
